# procedural-mesh-quad
Well if you watched the procedural mesh triangle video, the next logical step is to make the second easiest mesh - a quad. This video just goes a slight bit farther and makes a quad (or two triangles positioned to make a square). Hopefully we can start to see a pattern here before we start making more complex procedural meshes.
